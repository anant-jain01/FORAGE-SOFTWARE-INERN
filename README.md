# EA Software Engineering Virtual Experience (Forage)

This repository showcases my work from the **Electronic Arts (EA) Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). The program simulated real-world software engineering tasks at EA, including feature planning, debugging, system design, and implementation.

## 🗂️ Contents

- `Feature Proposal` – A written proposal for a new game feature, focusing on feasibility and player experience.
- `class_defination.cpp` – Identified and resolved logical bugs in a simulated codebase.
- `class_diagram.pdf` – UML class diagram showcasing relationships between game entities.
- `quiz` – A quiz from the duration of internship

## 🚀 Tasks & Learnings

### 1. 🎮 Feature Proposal  
Proposed a new in-game mechanic with potential for user engagement and inhanced in game feel. Considered:
- Gameplay enhancement
- Technical feasibility
- Alignment with EA’s brand

### 2. 🐞 Debugging Exercise  
Analyzed a broken C++ codebase, identified logical and syntactical bugs, and documented fixes.

### 3. 🧩 Class Diagram (UML)  
Created a UML diagram for core gameplay objects (e.g., Player, GameObject, Inventory). Designed for:
- Reusability
- Encapsulation
- Scalability

### 4. 💻 C++ Class Implementation  
Wrote clean, modular C++ classes using OOP principles (inheritance, polymorphism, constructors/destructors).

## 🧠 Key Skills Gained

- C++ (Object-Oriented Programming)
- UML & software architecture
- Debugging & error analysis
- Technical documentation
- Software feature pitching

## 📜 Certificate

Completed the EA Software Engineering Virtual Internship on Forage.
